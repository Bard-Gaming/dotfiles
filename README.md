# Dotfiles

## Description
This repository is used to easily distribute my personal
config across multiple devices / linux distros, as well
as being a backup.

## Scripts
You are free to use my scripts for your own config, but be careful;
some scripts aren't properly error-handled! The scripts that aren't
entirely safe are the ones that aren't in the following 'safe' list:

**List of 'safe' scripts:**
- [function-check](https://github.com/Bard-Gaming/dotfiles/blob/main/.custom_scripts/function-check) 
- [c-style](https://github.com/Bard-Gaming/dotfiles/blob/main/.custom_scripts/c-style)
