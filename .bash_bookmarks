# This file manages bash "bookmarks". These bookmarks are
# env variables you can "cd" into.
#
# Bookmarks should be named after the directory they point to.
# For instance, the bookmark for "~/Documents/notes" should
# be "notes" or a similar enough derivative of "notes".
# This ensures some coherence between bookmarks and directories.
#

# Enable bookmarks.
# This is done here to prevent users from accidentally
# change into a directory they don't want to if bookmarks
# aren't enabled.
